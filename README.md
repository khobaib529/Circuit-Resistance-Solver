# Circuit Resistance Solver

This project implements a graph-based algorithm in C++ for calculating the total resistance of a circuit represented as a directed graph. The algorithm's approach is discussed in detail in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@khobaib529/solving-electrical-circuits-a-graph-based-algorithm-for-resistance-calculations-921575c59946)

## Build and Run

To build and run the Circuit Resistance Solver, follow these steps:
